PHP code examples for the SOLID rules, referring to the blog post: 

[Solid PHP - SOLID principles in PHP](https://accesto.com/blog/solid-php-solid-principles-in-php/)

<hr />

### Single responsibility principle  (SRP)

> There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.

[SRP - explanation](https://accesto.com/blog/solid-php-solid-principles-in-php#SingleResponsibilityPrinciple)

#### Examples:
- [single-responsibility-principle BAD](https://github.com/accesto/solid-php/blob/master/single-responsibility-principle/single-responsibility-principle-bad.php)
- [single-responsibility-principle GOOD](https://github.com/accesto/solid-php/blob/master/single-responsibility-principle/single-responsibility-principle-good.php)

<hr />

### Open/closed principle (OCP)

> Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

[OCP - explanation](https://accesto.com/blog/solid-php-solid-principles-in-php#OpenClosedPrinciple)

#### Examples:
- [open-closed-principle BAD](https://github.com/accesto/solid-php/blob/master/open-closed-principle/open-closed-principle-bad.php)
- [open-closed-principle GOOD](https://github.com/accesto/solid-php/blob/master/open-closed-principle/open-closed-principle-good.php)

<hr />

### Liskov substitution principle (LSP)

> Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.

[LSP - explanation](https://accesto.com/blog/solid-php-solid-principles-in-php#LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple)

#### Examples:
- [liskov-substitution-principle BAD](https://github.com/accesto/solid-php/blob/master/liskov-substitution-principle/liskov-substitution-principle-bad.php)
- [liskov-substitution-principle GOOD](https://github.com/accesto/solid-php/blob/master/liskov-substitution-principle/liskov-substitution-principle-good.php)

<hr />

### Interface segregation principle (ISP)

> Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

[ISP - explanation](https://accesto.com/blog/solid-php-solid-principles-in-php#InterfaceSegregationPrinciple)

#### Examples:
- [interface-segregation-principle BAD](https://github.com/accesto/solid-php/blob/master/interface-segregation-principle/interface-segregation-principle-bad.php)
- [interface-segregation-principle GOOD](https://github.com/accesto/solid-php/blob/master/interface-segregation-principle/interface-segregation-principle-good.php)

<hr />

### Dependency inversion principle (DIP)

> Depend upon abstractions, NOT concretions.

[DIP - explanation](https://accesto.com/blog/solid-php-solid-principles-in-php#DependencyInversionPrinciple)

#### Examples:
- [dependency-inversion-principle BAD](https://github.com/accesto/solid-php/blob/master/dependency-inversion-principle/dependency-inversion-principle-bad.php)
- [dependency-inversion-principle GOOD](https://github.com/accesto/solid-php/blob/master/dependency-inversion-principle/dependency-inversion-principle-good.php)
